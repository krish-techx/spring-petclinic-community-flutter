# Spring Petclinic Flutter

[![Flutter CI](https://github.com/San-43/spring-petclinic-flutter/actions/workflows/dart.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/San-43/spring-petclinic-flutter/actions/workflows/dart.yml)

Flutter frontend for Spring Petclinic. This app targets Android and web, mirrors
the functional flows of the Angular frontend, and uses the same REST backend exposed by
`spring-petclinic-rest`.

## Backend

Start the backend first:

```bash
cd ~/spring-petclinic-rest
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The expected API is:

```text
http://localhost:9966/petclinic/api
```

## API configuration

The app resolves the API base URL in this order:

1. `PETCLINIC_API_BASE_URL` passed with `--dart-define`
2. Platform default

Platform defaults:

- Android emulator: `http://10.0.2.2:9966/petclinic/api`
- Web: `http://localhost:9966/petclinic/api`
- Other non-Android platforms: `http://localhost:9966/petclinic/api`

That logic lives in:

```text
lib/shared/config/api_config.dart
```

Override it at runtime when needed:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=PETCLINIC_API_BASE_URL=http://<host>:9966/petclinic/api
```

Use an explicit override when:

- running on a physical Android device;
- serving the web app against a backend that is not on `localhost`;
- pointing the app to a shared/staging backend.

## Run on Android

For an Android emulator:

```bash
cd ~/spring-petclinic-flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

For a physical Android device, pass the host machine IP explicitly:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define=PETCLINIC_API_BASE_URL=http://<host>:9966/petclinic/api
```

## Run on Web

For local browser development against the backend running on the same machine:

```bash
cd ~/spring-petclinic-flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

If the backend is not reachable at `http://localhost:9966/petclinic/api`, pass an override:

```bash
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=PETCLINIC_API_BASE_URL=http://<host>:9966/petclinic/api
```

## Build

Build an Android debug APK:

```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

Build the web app:

```bash
flutter build web
```

## Validation

Typical checks:

```bash
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter build apk --debug
flutter build web
```
